# DLT Workshop

This repository serves as a practical tutorial for using `dlt` (dlthub.com). It collects step‑by‑step lessons, example code, and configuration notes designed to help readers quickly understand the core concepts and reproduce the examples locally.

Follow the Getting Started section to set up the environment, then progress through the numbered tutorials and examples in the `dlt_tutorial/` directory.
